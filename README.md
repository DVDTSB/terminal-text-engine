# Welcome to the Slighty Improoved Terminal Only Text Adventure Engine!

## What this is

This is a rewrite of Text-Engine by okaybenji ( https://github/okaybenji/text-engine ) I made because I liked his way of doing it a lot, but felt like it could be better ( like adding custom actions )

## What it offers

It offers more customaztion and features, like online game sharing. ( in the future I will host a game sharing thingy on https://bananier.science )

It is only avalibale as a terminal app because I do not know how to vanilla javascript, but I will maybe add it if I get really bored one day.

I am not responsible for any damage you may cause to your computer ( I really am not).

## As a game creator

As a game creator you bundle your games into these .disk files, (they are just javascript files but .disk is fancy). To learn how to make these files and games, check the WIKI page of this project.

## As a player

As a player you just need to do the follow : Clone this repository, run `npm i`, and then run `node .`.
From here you can either play a game, or download a game.
